I was inspired by the YearCompass PDF's, because I don't like to fill out PDF's. 

Overview

Features
- Yearly Recap: Create digital recaps of your past years, summarizing achievements, challenges, and lessons learned.

- Yearly Planning: Plan for the upcoming year by setting goals, priorities, and intentions.

- PDF Export: Generate and download PDF versions of your recaps for offline access and printing.
